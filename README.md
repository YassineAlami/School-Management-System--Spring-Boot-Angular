<h3>Admins</h3>


Regarding classes, administrators can create an unlimited number by providing a name and year, with a tiny constraint that is 2 classes can not have the same name. Another attribute is the student count, which is read-only and automatically increments when a new student is added, as demonstrated in our simulation.

When admins create new students, they are required to enter the name and some personal information. A minor constraint is that the email must be unique. <br>
From a dropdown list of existing classes, admins should choose the class to which the newly added student belongs. <br>


<b>Once a student is assigned to a class, the student count for that class is incremented automatically <b><br>

Adding subjects is as easy as one, two, three, as demonstrated here. To assign a mark to a student, an administrator must first specify the student's class. Subsequently, they can select the student from the second dropdown list specific to that class. The assigned mark must fall between 0 and 20. Optionally, the administrator can add the date of the exam
