<h3>Admins</h3>


Regarding classes, administrators can create an unlimited number by providing a name and year, with a tiny constraint that is 2 classes can not have the same name. Another attribute is the student count, which is read-only and automatically increments when a new student is added, as demonstrated in our simulation.

When admins create new students, they are required to enter the name and some personal information. A minor constraint is that the email must be unique. <br>
From a dropdown list of existing classes, admins should choose the class to which the newly added student belongs. <br>
Once a student is assigned to a class, the student count for that class is incremented automatically <br>
